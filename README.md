# Meta repository

`meta` is a tool that helps you treat lots of repositories as monorepo without many of the downsides. Basically it allows you to keep CI integration simple and repositories small, while allowing git (and other) commands to be executed on all registered repositories.

## Install meta

`npm i -g meta`

## Clone the meta repository

`meta git clone git@github.com:nanoapi/meta.git`

## Sync registered repositories

`meta git update`
